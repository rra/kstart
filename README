BLURB

  k5start and krenew are modified versions of kinit which add support for
  running as a daemon to maintain a ticket cache, running a command with
  credentials from a keytab and maintaining a ticket cache until that
  command completes, obtaining AFS tokens (via an external aklog) after
  obtaining tickets, and creating an AFS PAG for a command.  They are
  primarily useful in conjunction with long-running jobs; for moving
  ticket handling code out of servers, cron jobs, or daemons; and to
  obtain tickets and AFS tokens with a single command.

DESCRIPTION

  k5start is a modified version of kinit.  It can be used as a substitute
  for kinit (with some additional helpful options), but it can also obtain
  credentials automatically from a keytab.  It can run as a daemon, waking
  up periodically to refresh credentials using that keytab, and can also
  check for the validity of tickets and only refresh if they're no longer
  valid.

  Some of these capabilities have been included in Kerberos's kinit, but
  the ability to maintain tickets while running as a daemon has not and is
  useful for servers that need to use Kerberos.  Using kstart allows the
  ticket handling to be moved out of the server into a separate process
  dedicated just to that purpose.

  k5start can optionally run an external program whenever the ticket is
  refreshed to obtain an AFS token, and therefore can be used in
  conjunction with a program like aklog or afslog to maintain an AFS
  token.  When built with support for AFS PAGs, it can also put the
  program in its own PAG so that its authentication doesn't affect any
  other programs.

  krenew is identical to k5start except that rather than obtaining new
  tickets from a password or keytab, it renews an existing renewable
  ticket cache.  It can be used to periodically renew tickets and
  optionally AFS tokens for long-running processes in cases where using a
  keytab is inappropriate (such as users running their own jobs with their
  own credentials).

REQUIREMENTS

  As Kerberos programs, k5start and krenew require Kerberos libraries to
  link against.  They have only been thoroughly tested with the MIT
  Kerberos and Heimdal libraries on Debian, but should work with the
  included Kerberos libraries on many other platforms.

  Other than that, all you should need is a suitable C compiler.  Neither
  program has been tested on non-Unix systems.

  If you want the -t option to work, you need a program to obtain AFS
  tokens from Kerberos tickets.  You can specify the program to use on
  your system with the --with-aklog option to configure; if that option is
  not given, the first of aklog or afslog that is found on your path at
  configure time will be used.

  For AFS PAG support, one of Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris 11, the kafs
  library that comes with either Heimdal or KTH Kerberos, the kopenafs
  library that comes with newer OpenAFS, AFS header files (on any other
  platform besides AIX or IRIX), or AFS libraries (on AIX and IRIX) is
  required.  AIX binaries with AFS PAG support may not run on AIX systems
  that do not have an AFS client installed due to how AIX handles system
  calls.

  To run the test suite, you must have the Perl 5.006 or later and the
  modules Test::More and Test::Pod installed.  Test::More comes with Perl
  5.8 or later and Test::Pod is available from CPAN.  You will also need
  the kinit and klist commands to be from MIT Kerberos, not Heimdal.

  To check spelling in the POD documentation, Pod::Spell (available from
  CPAN) and either aspell or ispell with the american dictionary are also
  required.  The user's path is searched for aspell or ispell and aspell
  is preferred.  Spelling tests are disabled by default since spelling
  dictionaries differ too much between systems.

  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local environment or that
  produce a lot of false positives without uncovering many problems,
  including the spelling tests, set RRA_MAINTAINER_TESTS to a true value.

  To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files
  and need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake 1.11 or
  later.  For bootstrap or if you change configure.ac or any of the m4
  files it includes and need to regenerate configure or config.h.in, you
  will need Autoconf 2.64 or later.  Perl is also required to generate
  the manual pages from a fresh Git checkout.

INSTALLATION

  Basic installation is simple.  Just run:

      ./configure
      make
      make install

  Pass --enable-silent-rules to configure for a quieter build (similar to
  the Linux kernel).  Use make warnings instead of make to build with full
  GCC compiler warnings (requires a relatively current version of GCC).

  This will build k5start and krenew and install them in /usr/local/bin
  with man pages in /usr/local/man/man1.  You may need to be root to run
  make install.  To install in a different location, specify a different
  location with the --prefix option to configure, as in:

      ./configure --prefix=/opt/sw

  Binaries would then be installed in /opt/sw/bin and man pages in
  /opt/sw/man/man1.  Alternately, --bindir and --mandir can be given to
  change the installation locations of the binaries and manual pages
  separately.

  Normally, configure will use krb5-config to determine the flags to use
  to compile with your Kerberos libraries.  If krb5-config isn't found, it
  will look for the standard Kerberos libraries in locations already
  searched by your compiler.  If the the krb5-config script first in your
  path is not the one corresponding to the Kerberos libraries you want to
  use or if your Kerberos libraries and includes aren't in a location
  searched by default by your compiler, you need to specify
  --with-krb5=PATH:

      ./configure --with-krb5=/usr/pubsw

  You can also individually set the paths to the include directory and the
  library directory with --with-krb5-include and --with-krb5-lib.  You may
  need to do this if Autoconf can't figure out whether to use lib, lib32,
  or lib64 on your platform.

  To specify a particular krb5-config script to use, either set the
  PATH_KRB5_CONFIG environment variable or pass it to configure like:

      ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/path/to/krb5-config

  To not use krb5-config and force library probing even if there is a
  krb5-config script on your path, set PATH_KRB5_CONFIG to a nonexistent
  path:

      ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/nonexistent

  If you are using aklog, afslog, or some other program to obtain AFS
  tokens, give its path to configure with the --with-aklog option, as in:

      ./configure --with-aklog=/usr/local/bin/aklog

  This program will be run when the -t option is given to k5start or
  krenew.

  To enable support for AFS PAGs, pass the --enable-setpag flag to
  configure.  It is not enabled by default.  On platforms other than Linux
  and without the kafs library, you will need to add the --with-afs flag
  specifying the location of your AFS includes and libraries unless
  they're on your standard search path.  For example:

      ./configure --enable-setpag --with-afs=/usr/afsws

  When enabled, k5start and krenew will always create a new PAG before
  authentication when running a specific command and when aklog is being
  run.

  You can build kstart in a different directory from the source if you
  wish.  To do this, create a new empty directory, cd to that directory,
  and then give the path to configure when running configure.  Everything
  else should work as above.

  You can pass the --enable-reduced-depends flag to configure to try to
  minimize the shared library dependencies encoded in the binaries.  This
  omits from the link line all the libraries included solely because the
  Kerberos libraries depend on them and instead links the programs only
  against libraries whose APIs are called directly.  This will only work
  with shared Kerberos libraries and will only work on platforms where
  shared libraries properly encode their own dependencies (such as Linux).
  It is intended primarily for building packages for Linux distributions
  to avoid encoding unnecessary shared library dependencies that make
  shared library migrations more difficult.  If none of the above made any
  sense to you, don't bother with this flag.

TESTING

  kstart comes with the beginnings of a test suite, which you can run
  with:

      make check

  In order to test the client in a meaningful way, you will need to do
  some preparatory work before running the test suite.  Review the file:

      tests/data/README

  and follow the instructions in that file to enable the full test suite.

  The test suite also requires some additional software be installed that
  isn't otherwise used by kstart.  See REQUIREMENTS above for the full
  list of requirements for the test suite.  The test driver attempts to
  selectively skip those tests for which the necessary configuration is
  not available, but this has not yet been fully tested in all of its
  possible permutations (and the test suite cannot cope with a missing
  Test::More module).

  If a test fails, you can run a single test with verbose output via:

      tests/runtests -o <name-of-test>

  Do this instead of running the test program directly since it will
  ensure that necessary environment variables are set up.

  To Navid Golpayegani, for contributing the initial implementation of the
  -b option to background after the initial authentication and the -p
  option to save the PID in a file.

  To Buck Huppmann, for contributing an RPM spec file and suggesting
  krenew.

  To Adam Megacz, for pointing out that checking the executability of the
  aklog program isn't necessary and for contributing the code to propagate
  signals to a child process.

  To Quanah Gibson-Mount, for pointing out various build system issues and

  To Thomas Kula, for pointing out that k_hasafs has to be called before
  k_setpag when using the kafs functions.

  To Thomas Weiss, for noticing that code restructuring caused the
  argument to -H to be ignored in k5start and that -H and -K should be
  diagnosed as mutually exclusive.

  To Mike Horansky, for the idea of copying the current ticket cache when
  running krenew with a command, thereby saving the ticket cache from
  destruction when the user logs out.

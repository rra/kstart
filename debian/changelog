kstart (4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V9.
    - Enable compiler hardening flags, including bindnow and PIE.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.

kstart (4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Ticket caches passed to k5start or krenew via -k are now used as-is
      without prepending FILE and therefore can be of any ticket cache
      type (unless k5start is called with -o, -g, or -m).  This may change
      the ticket cache name exposed to programs run under them.
    - Always canonicalize the ticket cache name for passing to commands.
    - krenew now stays running if obtaining renewed credentials fails, and
      only exits if the ticket cache disappears or is not renewable.  (-i
      still keeps it running in those cases as well.)  -x restores the
      previous behavior.
    - k5start now keeps running despite failures.  -x restores the
      previous behavior.
    - When k5start is run with the -o, -g, or -m options, it generates a
      temporary ticket cache first, sets ownership and permissions, and
      then renames it to the real ticket cache.
    - k5start and krenew now propagate SIGINT (Ctrl-C) to the child
      process rather than just exiting.
    - Set signal handlers with sigaction instead of signal to fix a bug in
      SIGCHLD handling.
    - Reject -U combined with -u or -i, or -H combined with a command.
  * Remove reference to arla from README.Debian.  That package was removed
    from Debian some years ago.
  * Update source package format to 3.0 (quilt).
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
  * Update to standards version 3.9.2 (no changes required).

Description: Kerberos kinit supporting AFS and ticket refreshing
 k5start can be used instead of kinit to obtain Kerberos tickets.  krenew
 can be used instead of kinit -R to renew renewable tickets.  They are
 intended primarily for use with automated or long-running processes and
 support some additional features useful for that purpose, such as running
 as a daemon and refreshing the ticket periodically, checking to see if an
 existing ticket has expired, or obtaining an AFS token along with the
 ticket by running an external program automatically.
